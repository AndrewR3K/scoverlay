# Star Citizen Overlay

**Description**:  Your one stop shop to all important community tools while in Star Citizen. _SC Overlay_ is an open source Star Citizen community utility tool and browser!

Other things to include:

  - **Technology stack**: This is a Node.js, Vue and Electron base application.
  - **Status**:  This tool is currently in Beta, you can select a version and see the changelogs [here](releases).

There are two primary ways to help: 
 - Using the issue tracker, and 
 - Changing the code-base.

**Using the issue tracker**:

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions. 
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.  

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code-base_ 
guidance below.


**Changing the code-base**

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull-request.  All new code should have associated unit
tests that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects. 
Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines 
prescribed by the project. In the absence of such guidelines, mimic the styles
and patterns in the existing code-base.
